- 👋 Hi, I’m @strohms
- 👀 I’m interested in truth and technology that helps humans connect. 
- 🌱 I am a lifelong learner. I wrote my first code (for money) in 1980. As you would imagine, some things have changed since then. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate. I plan to look at the sorts of projects that are available before I suggest anything new. Hopefully, I'll be able to look around the site and familiarize myself sufficiently within a few weeks. 
- 📫 How to reach me: sstrohm@protonmail.com
